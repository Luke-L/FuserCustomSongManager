FUSER CUSTOM SONG MANAGER
by N1nDr0id/Lilly.

This program was written for the Fuser community to make managing custom songs easier, as well as adding personal notes, ratings, and authors to each song.
PLEASE NOTE: No warranty is provided with use of this program. Please ensure that all of your songs are backed up elsewhere if you already have an existing custom song collection.
This program *should* be safe to use, but there may be issues that have been missed with my limited testing.
If you run into any issues with this program, please report them to the GitHub page for this project, which can be found here: https://github.com/N1nDr0id/FuserCustomSongManager

Thank you for using this program! I hope it helps :)
